Comment: Junior researchers often generate data during their PhD the analysis and consequential publication of which are crucial for them to receive a PhD at all (e.g. cumulative dissertation). It should therefore be allowed for junior researchers to publish their data only after they were able to analyse and publish for the benefit of their career. Timing (when to publish papers vs. publish the data) is important here. Publishing one's data before having been able to publish more results can be detrimental for a junior researcher's career.","I agree / I have nothing to add","","I agree / I have nothing to add","","I propose changes (in the comment field)","Replace this sentence with: &quot;UZH therefore supports openness at the earliest stage possible under the condition that the career-advancement of junior researchers is not harmed.&quot;","I propose changes (in the comment field)","Add here: &quot;The UZH supports [the publication of ...]&quot;","I propose changes (in the comment field)","As it stands, the load of the work will fall on the shoulders of the lowest group in the hierarchy that would be capable of making the data open - Junior researchers. Since the policy does not address any meaningful help (barring the data storage facilities) they will be left alone in making hard decisions, like anonymization where even professionals make mistakes. The policy could also lead to weird dynamics in the research when researchers invest a lot in obtaining the data, where articles will be held back and published in a bulk. In order to make as much data publishable and open as possible, the UZH must help researchers to overcome any barriers (e.g. technical support in the form of consultants and professionals for, e.g. anonymization and data management, researchers' freedom to publish the data only if not detrimental to their career advancement, etc.).","I propose changes (in the comment field)","Add here: The UZH provides support for data anonymization and how to make the data FAIR and takes responsibility for the anonymization process of the data of UZH researchers

Some open access publications are extremely costly and not all researchers are equally financed. Moreover, the UZH should aim for *sustainable* open science, meaning that the corresponding measures do not harm the interests and careers of researchers.  ","I agree / I have nothing to add","","I agree / I have nothing to add","","I propose changes (in the comment field)","No. It is crucial that UZH allows *delayed* open access of data. Otherwise, as soon as a researcher produces new data, then they immediately enter in competition with the whole world for analyzing this data. Very often it is the analysis that has the most value scientifically, so a requirement of early publication could be very damaging, especially to junior researcher careers.","I agree / I have nothing to add","","I propose changes (in the comment field)","I do not agree with the second bullet point (see my comment to point 5). What if I need to write a paper quickly, in order to increase my profile for applications for instance, but I do not want every other researcher in the world to have access to my data right after, because I still want to produce two more papers worth of analyses? Maybe I am an early career researcher which cannot afford being in competition with the whole world for analyzing data that I produced. I should be able to protect the fruits of my work. Why not offer the possibility of delayed publication of data, say two years, which achieves the same end-goal? Huge collaborations do this all the time, so forcing individuals to publish data prematurely would create an important imbalance. ","I agree / I have nothing to add","","I agree / I have nothing to add","","I propose changes (in the comment field)","Making a code publicly available requires a lot of time and energy spent on making it usable/understandable by other people than the developers (formatting, manuals, etc.). This has to be recognized as extra work, thus requiring extra resources, time, etc. Moreover, it might be detrimental to the career of junior researchers to be forced to spent a lot of time on making the code public, instead of using/developing that code further for research. So there should be the possibility of delaying code publication, or providing exterior workforce for the task.","I propose changes (in the comment field)","If UZH could *guarantee* funds for APCs for all, that would be ok in principle (e.g. not relying on the funds of direct superiors, as not everybody has such money from above). But this will not be the case. Moreover, the phrasing is ambiguous, as it is not clear whether Gold and Platinum are the *only* options (what about Green, not acceptable?). If this is so, then it is really not ok. Since UZH will not be cancelling journal subscriptions any time soon, we will be essentially giving double the tax-payer money to private for-profit publishers, who already have 99% of their job done for them by tax-payer money. This system was already bordering on public fund abuse before open access, and now we use open science as an excuse to double down. How come the Green option is not even mentioned, although it achieves the same amount of openness?","","","I propose changes (in the comment field)","And funding.","I agree / I have nothing to add","","I agree / I have nothing to add","","I agree / I have nothing to add","","I agree / I have nothing to add","","I agree / I have nothing to add","","I agree / I have nothing to add","","I propose changes (in the comment field)","UZH is part of the world system of research institutions, where not everyone hires with the same (DORA) criteria, and mobility in that world is not a choice but a prerequisite for an academic career. What if I prioritize open access, instead of high-impact factor in my publications, and then end up being less competitive on the global stage after I leave UZH? High-impact journals are not always open access, or with prohibitive APCs (e.g. Nature), so this can be a real issue, especially for junior researchers. Thus, the level of prioritization of open science in hiring/promoting/evaluating criteria should be thought about carefully and the corresponding statement expressed in a more nuanced manner.","I agree / I have nothing to add","","I propose changes (in the comment field)","If ""HR processes""; includes hiring, then ""requirements"" is too strong (see my comment to point 20).","I agree / I have nothing to add","","I propose changes (in the comment field)","The University should establish clear framework conditions to guarantee that the interests and careers of junior researchers are not harmed in pursuing the otherwise noble goal of open science.
